# usyslib

Some poor-programmed wrapper-like library for low-level system stuff.
(Code is almost completely from my another project, [ITClassHelper](https://github.com/UjhhgtgTeams/ITClassHelper), although it has been greatly improved.)

## Usage

1. Download prebuilt dll.
2. Include it in your project.
3. A simple `using` is what you need.

## Supported Platforms

- [x] Windows
- [ ] MacOS
- [ ] Linux (probably if I rewrite this)
- [ ] Literally Any Other
